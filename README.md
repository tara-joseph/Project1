# Natural Language Processing based Text Clustering

Problem Statement:
To cluster textual data with Natural Language Processing using clustering techniques after
finding the optimal number of clusters.

Objective:
Natural language processing (NLP) is used in text analysis to convert unstructured text in files
into normalized, structured data that can be analyzed and then used to run machine learning
(ML) algorithms. In this project, fundamental text analytical tasks, including text preprocessing and text document
clustering algorithm, are applied.
